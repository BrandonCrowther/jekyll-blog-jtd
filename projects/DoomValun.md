## Valun Pass - Doom Map


Valun Pass was a project born out of the COVID lockdowns. My interest in programming and the field of computer science first started out of an interest in modding - specifically modding Doom 2. The lockdowns were a perfect time to revisit the game and build something new from it.

A Youtube video of the map being played through is available [here](https://youtu.be/KQcAmghTbww).

The map is hosted and available for download [here](https://bcrowthe-doombucket.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ValunPass.pk3).
